The past weekend I travelled to Whistler for a two day ski trip with some college friends. I've probably skied 5 times in my life and would say that I'm a beginner with the desire to learn. Whistler and Blackcomb are two peaks separated by a valley and both of these peaks have ski runs ranging from easy greens to extremely difficult glacier blacks. Obviously, as a beginner you are bound to fall and so I fell and got up - this happened pretty regularly over the trip. I'm grateful that the falls weren't too bad and I was able to get back home in one piece with lots of great memories made. Throughout this trip and on the flight back I kept thinking about what exactly does risk mean and how it affects my life. In this post, I take a crack at defining risk in a general context and drawing parallels with what I learned about risk management - both in the context of life and trading.


### What is risk and how do I manage it? 

_*Risk*_ is defined as the possibility that something unpleasant will happen. The keyword here is the _possibility_ - which indicates the unpleasant event is random and may or may not happen. As I'm writing this I'm realizing that the word risk, as commonly used it is, is a vague and non-deterministic word that has an associated probability to it. Taking this idea forward, *risk management* then means the ability to manage the possibility of something unpleasant happening. To put it in other words, it attempts to reduce the probability of something unpleasant happening - ensuring a higher change of a pleasant outcome. Risk management is then an optimization problem where we want to minimize the probably of doom and maximize the probability of boon.

Now that the definitions have been layed out - let's look at some examples of risk and how we try to manage it in our day to day lives. 

- I'm at an intersection on the street and the crossing signal says to wait, but me being in a rush I decide to cross anyway. At this moment I've increased the risk of being hit by a vehicle. To manage and minimize the risk in this case, I should conciously decide to wait for the signal to turn _white_ (I'm in Toronto).
- I'm a beginner skier and know that I'm still learning to control my turns, out of excitement and adreneline I decide to take a lift to the top of a Black Diamond glacier - it's probably unwise because I'm risking significant injuries to my body and potentially my life. I managed this by keeping a cool head and sticking to the greens. 

As much as we try to quantify risk management, my personal experiences tell me that it's more behavioral than numerical in a lot of areas. Most of risk management is self and emotional management. 

Risk managment can be applied to all aspects of life covering all domains. Whether it's the difficulty of a ski run or a decision on how many billions to invest in AI, the art of risk  management is constant in our world. In the next section, I'll touch on risk management strategies that I recently learned in the realm of stock trading.
