Hello and welcome to this blog, a place where you'll find snapshotted instances of interesting rabbit holes. 

Here, you'll find me diving into concepts from software engineering, entrepreneurship, music, personal insights from the books I read, and occasionally my attempt at understanding philosophy, nature, and the spiritual world around us. I'm also building a collection of great resources for learning so give the [resources](https://blog.dashvin.com/resources) page a look.

I'm all for amazing conversations so please don't hesitate to reach out to me with any thoughts or additional insights at hello[at]dashvin.com. We're all here to learn together :)
