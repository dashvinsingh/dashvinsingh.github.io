It's funny how a year passes by really quickly these days. In January 2025, I set out to write regularly here and share my thoughts and learnings - but as you can see, I ended up writing only one article on [value](/blog/understanding-value). 

It's January 2026 and I've set a goal for myself to write 26 articles on this blog - giving myself two weeks to write one post, so here's post 1/26.

I keep asking myself, why bother writing publicly? What should I even write about? I don't think I have an answer for both of these questions yet, so I'll use the space below to try and answer them.


### Why do I want to write publicly? 

I've previously enjoyed periods of focused thinking and writing - when done right (and consistently), it takes me into a state of flow. It has been a while since I've experienced the flow state with writing - so that's one reason.

I like reading physical books and have done a great job in the past year to consistently read. My philosophy has been to read whatever interests me without the pressure of having to finish the book. That being said, I don't have a space where I can share or discuss my learnings and insights from the books I read, so I'm hoping this space allows me to do just that and build a collection of knowledge that I can easily refer to in the future and share it with friends and family. 

The internet is a great place of resources and I want to contribute a piece of myself to this collection. 

Writing is a skill and what better way to practice a skill publicly and learn from those that have been successful with the skill. I want to continuously improve my ability to articulate ideas clearly and that means writing and thinking with clarity.


### What do I write about?

This is an important question, but not having a clear answer at this moment is not necessarily a bad thing. A fuzzy answer is that I'll be writing about things that interest me: software, philosophy, books, movies, sports, and whatever interests I develop throughout the years. At the very minimum, I know that this blog will be valuable to 1 person on the internet and that is enough validation to keep going.

So, join me as I navigate 2026 and build a habit of writing and thinking with clarity. It will be a fun one.
