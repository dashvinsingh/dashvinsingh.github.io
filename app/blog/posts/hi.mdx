This is Python
```python
def foo():
    return "Bar"
```

This is Haskell
```haskell
fib :: PositiveInt -> PositiveInt
fib 0 = 0
fib 1 = 1

This is an ordered list:
1. Item One
2. Item Two
3. Item Three
5. Item Four

This is an unordered list:
- Hello
- How do you do

This is how you add an item under a list:
* First item
* Second Item
    ```python
    def foo():
        return bar
    ```
* Third item

This creates a divider
