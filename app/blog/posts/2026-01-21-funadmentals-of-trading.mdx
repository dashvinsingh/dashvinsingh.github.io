I've always been curious about markets, stocks, trading, investments, and crypto. Yes, these are all buzzwords we hear on the news and all over r/wallstreetbets - and to be really frank, there was a time where I would react to these buzzwords on reddit threads out of _fomo_. But honestly, isn't this the most common, yet most destructive mistake, a rookie can make? I've made those rookie mistakes, and I sometime still make them. In an effort to make lesser of these mistakes, I've decided to spend time trying to understand what these buzzwords really mean. In this post, I'll go through how I used to invest (more like speculate), how I used to make decisions, and what emotions drove my decision making. I'll spend some words defining and discussing markets, trading vs investments, and my recent lessons on risk management. A blog post will definitely not make me an expert in all these buzzwords, but it sure starts a journey of deliberate learning and understanding.

### My journey of learning and mistakes
I grew up hearing about the stock market and stories of how people lose everything on it - homes and families destroyed, debt and financial lossess, you name it. So, for the longest time, I've always looked at stock and crypto markets like a gambling venue, a casino per say. Hearing about stories where people lose on the market led me to develop a fear of putting my money on it. Obviously, the fear did not stop me from playing the game, but I realized that I would hold back on investing a large amount or perhaps make bold moves and adopt a YOLO mindset. This lack of knowledge combined with some regretful trades pushed me in the direction of learning more about it. I became motivated to better understand the system and learn how to play the winning game - which, I realized is less technical and more behavioral. I've made mistakes, you've made mistakes, so let's take the time to slowly build our knowledge from the ground up, in an attempt to make fewer and less costly mistakes. 

### The Market
One of the books I started reading in an attempt to tame the fear was _The Intelligent Investor_ by Benjamin Graham. A key lesson that I remember from the book is that: _Mr. Market will knock at your door every trading day with the current price depending on his mood. If Mr. Market is feeling fearful, the price is low, and if he's greedy, prices will be high. As participants in the market, we should be emotionally unphased with the dailying pricing of Mr. Market._ Obviously, this is easier said than done because don't we all want to make easy money? Anyways, this lesson has stuck with me since, and as a result I've been much calmer in making decisions. I don't care too much about the daily movements as I used to.

To better understand The Market, let's step back and start from the definition:
> a means by which the exchange of goods and services takes place as a result of buyers and sellers being in contact with one another, either directly or through mediating agents or institutions

The first thing that comes on my mind is a farmer's market. It is a physical space where farmers and businesses come with their products with the intention to sell and make a profit. In this physical space, there will be buyers of all sorts who may be intereted... TBC
